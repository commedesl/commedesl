# Hi, I'm Lin Mo 👋

🎯 A beginner Python developer on a career-changing journey into the tech world.

🌱 In 2015, I went to Canada for working holiday, where I gained independence, resilience, and a global perspective.  
Years later, I decided to pursue my passion for technology by self-learning programming, with the goal of becoming a backend engineer.

🛠️ My current learning focus includes:
- Python (FreeCodeCamp, LeetCode)
- Data Structures and Algorithms (Binary Trees, Merge Sort)
- Basic Web Development (HTML, CSS)

🚀 I believe it's never too late to start. Step by step, I'm building my skills to create useful, efficient, and meaningful software.

🔗 My Projects:
- [Binary Search Tree Project](https://github.com/commedesl/Binary_Search_Tree_Project)
- [Merge Sort Practice](https://github.com/commedesl/Merge_Sort)

💬 Future Goals:
- Become a backend engineer
- Build small full-stack projects using Flask and SQL
- Contribute to open-source projects
